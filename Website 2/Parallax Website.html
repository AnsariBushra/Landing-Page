<h2><u>Section One</h2></u>
<p>Hey there, My name is Bushra and this is my first parallex website. So parallax website is one in which background images move past the camera more slowly than foreground images, creating an ilussion of depth in a 2D scene of distance. So get ready for the further website. Scroll down for seeing the further website.</p>
